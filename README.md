# Speech MRI segmentation
This repository contains Python code to perform deep-learning-based segmentation of two-dimensional real-time magnetic resonance images of the vocal tract during speech. Code to train a segmentation convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch is included, as well as code to estimate segmentations using trained segmentation CNNs.
